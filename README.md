**Karate Kido** is a game where a Karate master chops a tree into wooden pieces 🪓🌲 while dodging dangerous branches 🌿. Quick reflexes 🏃‍♂️ and sharp focus 🧠 are key to reaching higher levels! The gameplay includes:
1. **Player Goal**: Chop the tree by selecting the correct side (left or right) of the screen! 👈👉  
2. **Challenge**: Avoid branches, break glass panels, and collect glowing lanterns as you progress! ✨💡  
3. **Levels**: From basic wood chopping to handling dynamic obstacles and scoring bonuses! 💪🔥
